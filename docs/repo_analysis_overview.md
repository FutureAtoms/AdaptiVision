# AdaptiVision Repository Analysis Overview

This document provides a summary of the files within the AdaptiVision repository.

## File Summaries

*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pt` weights, local datasets, `.DS_Store`).
*   **`LICENSE`**: Contains the MIT License text, granting permissions for usage, modification, and distribution.
*   **`README.md`**: The main project README. Provides an overview, key features, installation instructions, usage examples (CLI and API), project structure, links to detailed results, and technical explanations of the adaptive thresholding mechanism.
*   **`coco128_config.yaml`**: Configuration file for the COCO128 dataset, defining paths and class names used by the Ultralytics library.
*   **`datasets/`**: Directory intended to hold datasets. Currently contains:
    *   **`coco/`**: Contains the downloaded COCO 2017 dataset.
        *   `images/`: Contains `train2017/` and `val2017/` subdirectories with the respective image files.
        *   `annotations/`: Contains the `annotations_trainval2017.json` and related annotation files.
*   **`docs/ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD.md`**: Technical documentation detailing the Adaptive Context-Aware Confidence Thresholding technique, including scene complexity calculation, threshold adjustment formulas, class-specific adjustments, and context reasoning logic.
*   **`examples/basic_detection.py`**: Example Python script demonstrating basic usage of the `AdaptiVision` detector class for single-image detection and visualization. Includes argument parsing and basic results printing.
*   **`examples/batch_processing.py`**: Example script for processing multiple images in a directory. Supports parallel processing using `concurrent.futures` and optionally saves detailed results as JSON.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project (e.g., `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `torch`, `ultralytics`, `matplotlib`).
*   **`results/coco128_experiment/`**: Directory containing results from an experiment run on a subset of the COCO128 dataset. Includes:
    *   `adaptive/`: Output images from the adaptive detection method.
    *   `analytics/`: Plots and summary statistics (`.png`, `.json`).
    *   `comparisons/`: Side-by-side comparison images (`comparison_*.jpg`) and a `README.md` linking them.
    *   `detailed_results.json`: Raw data for each image processed in the experiment.
    *   `experiment_report.md`: Markdown report summarizing the experiment findings with embedded analytics plots.
    *   `standard/`: Output images from the standard detection method.
    *   `summary_results.csv`: CSV summary of key metrics for each image.
    *   `visualizations/`: Likely contains detailed visualizations (e.g., heatmaps) if generated by `create_visualizations.py`.
*   **`results/full_coco128_experiment/`**: Directory containing results from an experiment run on the *full* COCO128 dataset. Structure mirrors `coco128_experiment/` but contains results for all 128 images.
*   **`results/research_paper/`**: (Note: `paper.md` and `README.md` were not found, potentially outdated references in `README.md`). Contains `architecture.svg`.
*   **`samples/`**: Directory containing sample images (`.jpg`) for testing and demonstration purposes, including subdirectories `batch/`, `coco/`, `coco2/`.
*   **`scripts/prepare_subset.py`**: Python script to create a random subset of images from a source directory, copying files and generating a `metadata.json`.
*   **`scripts/reproduce_experiment.py`**: Script to automate the reproduction of the COCO128 experiment, including downloading the dataset and weights, creating the subset, and running the experiment script.
*   **`scripts/run_experiments.py`**: Main script for running experiments. Processes images in a data directory using both standard and adaptive detection, saves results, comparisons, and generates analytics plots and summary files (`detailed_results.json`, `summary_results.csv`, `experiment_report.md`).
*   **`setup.py`**: Standard Python package setup script using `setuptools`. Defines package metadata, dependencies (from `requirements.txt`), and entry points (creating the `adaptivision` console command).
*   **`src/adaptivision.py`**: Core implementation of the `AdaptiVision` class. Handles model loading (YOLOv8), prediction pipeline, scene complexity calculation, adaptive threshold adjustment, context-aware reasoning, and result visualization.
*   **`src/cli.py`**: Implements the command-line interface using `argparse`. Defines subcommands (`detect`, `visualize`, `compare`, `batch`) and orchestrates calls to the appropriate modules (`adaptivision.py`, `create_visualizations.py`, `compare_methods.py`, `batch_processing.py`).
*   **`src/compare_methods.py`**: Script to perform a direct comparison between standard and adaptive detection on a single image, generating a side-by-side visualization.
*   **`src/create_visualizations.py`**: Script dedicated to generating detailed visualizations related to the adaptive thresholding process, such as complexity heatmaps and threshold maps (referenced in `run_experiments.py`).
*   **`src/utils.py`**: Contains utility functions used across the project, including device selection (`select_device`), image loading/preprocessing (`load_image`, `resize_and_pad`), bounding box adjustments (`adjust_boxes_to_original`), and drawing functions (`draw_detections`).
