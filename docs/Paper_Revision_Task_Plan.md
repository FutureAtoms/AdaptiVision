## PHASE 1: Verification and Fact-Checking

**Goal:** Ensure all reported numbers, figures, and descriptions in the paper match the final experimental outputs and code implementation.

-   [✅] **1.1 Verify Table 1 (mAP/AR Results):**
    -   *Action:* Cross-reference every value in Table 1 (`tab:map_results`) against the standard COCO evaluation summary output files (e.g., `results/ablations/baseline_eval.txt`, `results/ablations/adaptivision_full_eval.txt` or similar definitive evaluation outputs).
    -   *Status:* Verified. Values match `results/ablations/baseline_eval.txt` and `results/ablations/adaptivision_full_eval.txt`.
-   [✅] **1.2 Verify Table 2 (Count/Time Results):**
    -   *Action:* Verify the average object counts (Standard fixed 0.25 vs AdaptiVision) and average processing times against the summary statistics generated by `scripts/run_experiments.py` (check `results/*.csv` or report files). Confirm the 1.49x speedup calculation.
    -   *Status:* Verified. Values match rounded figures in `results/coco_full_arxiv/analytics/summary_statistics.json`.
-   [✅] **1.3 Verify Figure 1 (Architecture):**
    -   *Action:* Ensure `figures/architecture.png` accurately depicts the processing pipeline described in the Methodology section and implemented in `src/adaptivision.py`.
    -   *Status:* Verified. Figure caption aligns with Methodology description and `src/adaptivision.py` implementation.
-   [✅] **1.4 Verify Figure 3 (Distribution Plots):**
    -   *Action:* Confirm that the plots in `figures/` (e.g., `object_count_difference_distribution.png`, `processing_time_difference_distribution.png`, `speed_improvement_distribution.png`, `complexity_distribution.png`) correctly visualize the data generated by `scripts/run_experiments.py` and match their captions.
    -   *Status:* Verified. Plots generated by script, captions match. Files copied to `figures/` directory.
-   [✅] **1.5 Verify Figure 4 (Scatter Plots):**
    -   *Action:* Confirm that the scatter plots in `figures/` (e.g., `object_count_scatter.png`, `processing_time_scatter.png`) correctly visualize the per-image data from `scripts/run_experiments.py` and match their captions.
    -   *Status:* Verified. Plots generated by script, captions match. Files copied to `figures/` directory.
-   [✅] **1.6 Verify Figures 5 & 6 (Qualitative Examples):**
    -   *Action:* Ensure the comparison images referenced in Figure 5 (e.g., `figures/comparison_*.jpg`) exist, are representative, and correspond to the image IDs mentioned. Verify the complexity visualization in Figure 6.
    -   *Status:* Verified. Referenced images generated by script, captions match IDs. Files copied to `figures/` directory.
-   [✅] **1.7 Verify Methodology Description:**
    -   *Action:* Briefly re-read the Methodology section and compare against key parameters and logic in `src/adaptivision.py` (complexity weights, threshold mapping logic, context rules, etc.) to ensure perfect alignment.
    -   *Status:* Verified. Methodology description aligns with code implementation details (complexity, thresholding, context, etc.).
-   [✅] **1.8 Verify GitHub Link:**
    -   *Action:* Check the URL provided in the Implementation Details subsection (`\url{https://github.com/FutureAtoms/AdaptiVision/}`) is correct and accessible.
    -   *Status:* Verified (URL format correct, accessibility check failed - recommend manual check).

## PHASE 2: Content Enhancement and Refinement

**Goal:** Incorporate additional findings to strengthen the paper's analysis and discussion, and refine the narrative.

-   [✅] **2.1 Enhance Discussion with Ablation Results:**
    -   *Action:* Add a paragraph to the Discussion section detailing the results of the ablation study (mAP for AdaptiveOnly, ContextOnly). Explain how these results support the conclusion that the core heuristic approach, not just the combination, failed to improve mAP. Reference the relevant results files (e.g., `results/ablations/*_eval.txt`).
    -   *Status:* Done. Added paragraph summarizing ablation results (AP=0.340 for both AdaptiveOnly and ContextOnly, same as full method) and referencing files.
-   [✅] **2.2 Enhance Discussion with Post-Processing Filter Results:**
    -   *Action:* Add a sentence or two to the Discussion clarifying that the final geometric post-processing filter was evaluated and found to have negligible impact on mAP, ruling it out as the cause for the performance drop. Reference the relevant results file (e.g., `results/ablations/adaptivision_no_postfilter_eval.txt`).
    -   *Status:* Done. Added sentences clarifying negligible mAP impact (AP=0.340) and referencing file.
-   [✅] **2.3 (Optional) Enhance Discussion with Complexity Bins:**
    -   *Action:* Consider adding a brief mention in the Discussion that the mAP degradation was observed across low, medium, and high complexity image subsets, further challenging the effectiveness of the scene-adaptive approach based on these heuristics. Reference `results/ablations/*_eval_with_complexity.txt`.
    -   *Status:* Done. Added sentence showing mAP degradation across complexity bins, referencing files.
-   [✅] **2.4 Review Abstract and Conclusion:**
    -   *Action:* After incorporating other findings, re-read the Abstract and Conclusion to ensure they still accurately and concisely summarize the key message and contributions, potentially adjusting wording slightly for clarity.
    -   *Status:* Done. Abstract and Conclusion accurately reflect updated findings; no changes needed.
-   [✅] **2.5 (Optional) Add PR Curves:**
    -   *Action:* Decide whether to include the generated PR curves (e.g., `*_pr_curve.png`) in the main paper (perhaps replacing a qualitative figure) or as supplementary material. If included, add a figure and reference it in the Results section.
    -   *Status:* Done. Decided against adding PR curves to main paper for space considerations; results clear without them.

## PHASE 3: Final Review and Formatting

**Goal:** Perform final checks for consistency, clarity, grammar, and LaTeX formatting.

-   [✅] **3.1 Proofread Entire Paper:**
    -   *Action:* Read through the entire paper carefully to correct any typos, grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or inconsistencies in terminology.
    -   *Status:* Done (AI Pass). No major issues found, terminology consistent. Final human proofread recommended.
-   [✅] **3.2 Check Figure/Table References:**
    -   *Action:* Ensure all figures and tables are correctly referenced in the text using `\ref{}` and that the references make sense in context.
    -   *Status:* Done. All references match defined labels and appear correct in context.
-   [✅] **3.3 Check Citations:**
    -   *Action:* Verify all citations (`\cite{}`) correspond to entries in the bibliography and are formatted correctly.
    -   *Status:* Done. All \cite{} match \bibitem{}. PyTorch uncited. Recommend switching to BibTeX for robust formatting/ArXiv standard.
-   [✅] **3.4 Compile LaTeX Document:**
    -   *Action:* Compile the final `.tex` document to ensure there are no LaTeX errors or warnings. Check the output PDF for any formatting issues (e.g., figures overlapping text, table widths).
    -   *Status:* Done. Compiled successfully (after fixes). Several Overfull \hbox warnings remain, recommend manual PDF check for formatting.
