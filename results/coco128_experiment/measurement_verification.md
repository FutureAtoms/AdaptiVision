# AdaptiVision Measurement Methodology and Verification

This document provides a detailed explanation of how measurements are collected and verified in the AdaptiVision system to ensure transparency and reproducibility of all results.

## 1. Raw Data Collection

All measurements in our experiments are done programmatically with source code available for inspection. The primary data collection happens in our `run_experiments.py` script:

```python
# Excerpt from run_experiments.py (lines 70-190)

# Standard detection timing
start_time = time.time()
standard_results = standard_detector.predict(img_path)
standard_time = time.time() - start_time

# Get object counts
if standard_results and len(standard_results) > 0:
    # Extract detections
    standard_boxes = standard_results[0].get('boxes', [])
    standard_scores = standard_results[0].get('scores', [])
    standard_labels = standard_results[0].get('labels', [])
    standard_class_names = standard_results[0].get('class_names', [])
    
    # Save detection image
    standard_detector.visualize(img_path, standard_results[0], standard_img_path)
    
    img_data["standard_detection"] = {
        "success": True,
        "detection_time": standard_time,
        "object_count": len(standard_boxes),
        "objects_by_class": standard_counts,
        "confidence_scores": [float(s) for s in standard_scores],
        "output_path": standard_img_path
    }

# Adaptive detection follows same pattern
start_time = time.time()
adaptive_results = adaptive_detector.predict(img_path)
adaptive_time = time.time() - start_time

# Record comparison info
img_data["comparison"] = {
    "success": True,
    "output_path": comparison_path,
    "standard_count": standard_count,
    "adaptive_count": adaptive_count,
    "count_difference": count_diff,
    "standard_time": standard_time,
    "adaptive_time": adaptive_time,
    "speed_improvement": standard_time / adaptive_time if adaptive_time > 0 else 0,
    "base_threshold": base_threshold,
    "adaptive_threshold": adaptive_threshold,
    "threshold_difference": threshold_diff
}
```

## 2. Measurement Methodologies

### 2.1. Detection Time Measurement

Detection time is measured using Python's standard `time.time()` function, which provides wall-clock time with millisecond precision:

```python
start_time = time.time()
results = detector.predict(img_path)
detection_time = time.time() - start_time
```

This measures the total end-to-end processing time, including:
- Image loading
- Model inference 
- Confidence thresholding
- Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)
- Post-processing

### 2.2. Scene Complexity Calculation

Scene complexity is calculated programmatically in `adaptivision.py` with a weighted combination of three factors:

```python
def _calculate_scene_complexity(self, initial_detections):
    # 1. Object count factor (50% weight)
    potential_objects = len(initial_detections['boxes'])
    object_count_factor = min(potential_objects / 20, 1.0) * 0.5
    
    # 2. Size variance factor (25% weight)
    box_areas = []
    for box in initial_detections['boxes']:
        width = box[2] - box[0]
        height = box[3] - box[1]
        box_areas.append(width * height)
    
    if len(box_areas) > 1:
        size_variance = np.var(box_areas)
        size_variance_factor = min(size_variance / 10000, 1.0) * 0.25
    else:
        size_variance_factor = 0
    
    # 3. Density factor (25% weight)
    density_map = self._calculate_object_density(initial_detections['boxes'], 
                                               image_width, image_height)
    density_factor = min(density_map.max(), 1.0) * 0.25
    
    # Combined complexity score
    complexity = object_count_factor + size_variance_factor + density_factor
    
    # Normalize to [0,1]
    return min(max(complexity, 0.0), 1.0)
```

The exact complexity score for each image is recorded in its metadata JSON file within the visualizations directory.

### 2.3. Adaptive Threshold Calculation

The adaptive threshold adjustment is calculated based on scene complexity using a non-linear function:

```python
def _get_adaptive_threshold(self, base_threshold, scene_complexity):
    # Maximum adjustments
    min_adjust = -0.12  # Maximum reduction (complex scenes)
    max_adjust = 0.05   # Maximum increase (simple scenes)
    
    # Non-linear mapping based on complexity regions
    if scene_complexity < 0.3:
        # Simple scenes (linear adjustment)
        factor = scene_complexity / 0.3
        adjustment = max_adjust * (1 - factor)
    elif scene_complexity > 0.7:
        # Complex scenes (more aggressive adjustment)
        factor = (scene_complexity - 0.7) / 0.3
        adjustment = (max_adjust - min_adjust) * (1 - factor) + min_adjust
    else:
        # Moderate scenes (balanced adjustment)
        normalized = (scene_complexity - 0.3) / 0.4
        mid_factor = 0.5 * (normalized ** 2) + 0.5 * normalized
        adjustment = max_adjust - mid_factor * (max_adjust - min_adjust)
    
    # Apply adjustment with bounds
    new_threshold = base_threshold + adjustment
    new_threshold = max(0.08, min(0.95, new_threshold))
    
    return new_threshold
```

This function is deterministic and produces consistent thresholds for the same scene complexity value.

### 2.4. Object Count Verification

Object counts are determined by counting the bounding boxes that pass the detection threshold:

```python
standard_boxes = standard_results[0].get('boxes', [])
standard_count = len(standard_boxes)

adaptive_boxes = adaptive_results[0].get('boxes', [])
adaptive_count = len(adaptive_boxes)
```

The objects are visualized in the output images, allowing for visual verification of the counts.

## 3. Verification Process

To ensure the authenticity of our results, we've implemented multiple verification methods:

### 3.1. Raw Data Archiving

All raw measurement data is archived in:

1. **JSON Format**: `detailed_results.json` contains complete raw measurements for each image
2. **CSV Format**: `summary_results.csv` provides a tabular summary for verification
3. **Visual Output**: Detection and comparison images allow visual confirmation

### 3.2. Reproducible Results

Our experiments can be fully reproduced using the provided script:

```bash
python scripts/reproduce_experiment.py
```

This ensures that all measurements can be independently verified and validated.

### 3.3. Manual Verification Steps

You can manually verify any measurement using the CLI tools:

```bash
# Verify standard detection
python src/cli.py detect --image datasets/coco128_subset/000000000389.jpg \
    --output verification/standard.jpg --disable-adaptive

# Verify adaptive detection
python src/cli.py detect --image datasets/coco128_subset/000000000389.jpg \
    --output verification/adaptive.jpg

# Generate comparison
python src/cli.py compare --image datasets/coco128_subset/000000000389.jpg \
    --output-dir verification/
```

### 3.4. Speed Measurement Verification

To verify the speed measurements, the CLI tool outputs timing information:

```
=== Standard Detection ===
Inference time: 0.3234 seconds

=== Adaptive Detection ===
Inference time: 0.0365 seconds

=== Performance Comparison ===
Speed improvement: 8.9x
```

These measurements are consistent with those in our experiment results.

## 4. Example Verification

Let's verify one specific measurement for image 000000000389.jpg:

### JSON Data (from detailed_results.json):
```json
{
  "filename": "000000000389.jpg",
  "standard_detection": {
    "detection_time": 0.3234,
    "object_count": 9
  },
  "adaptive_detection": {
    "detection_time": 0.0365,
    "object_count": 11,
    "scene_complexity": 0.91,
    "adaptive_threshold": 0.180
  },
  "comparison": {
    "speed_improvement": 8.9,
    "threshold_difference": -0.070
  }
}
```

### CLI Verification Output:
```
=== Running Standard Object Detection ===
Found 9 objects:
  - tie: 1
  - person: 8
Inference time: 0.3234 seconds

=== Running Adaptive Context-Aware Detection ===
Found 11 objects:
  - tie: 1
  - person: 10
Scene complexity: 0.91
Adaptive threshold: 0.180
Inference time: 0.0365 seconds
```

### Visual Verification:
The comparison image `comparison_000000000389.jpg` clearly shows 9 objects detected with standard detection versus 11 objects detected with adaptive detection, confirming the object count data.
