## Key Findings

The experiments on the COCO128 dataset demonstrate several advantages of AdaptiVision's adaptive thresholding approach:

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: AdaptiVision automatically adjusts detection thresholds based on scene complexity, ranging from 0.08 (complex scenes) to 0.30 (simple scenes).

2. **Improved Detection Quality**: Adaptive thresholding recovers valid objects in complex scenes while filtering false positives in simple scenes.

3. **Significant Speed Improvement**: AdaptiVision detection is substantially faster than standard detection while maintaining quality.

4. **Minimal Computational Overhead**: The adaptive thresholding mechanism adds only 4-7ms to processing time.

## Analytics Summary

- **Scene Complexity Analysis**: Distribution of scene complexity scores across the dataset.
- **Threshold Adaptation Patterns**: Correlation between scene complexity and threshold adjustments.
- **Detection Performance**: Comparison of object counts between standard and adaptive detection.
- **Speed Analysis**: Processing time comparison and speed improvement distribution.

## Result Verification

To ensure our results are transparent and reproducible, we provide detailed documentation on how each measurement is conducted and verified:

- [Measurement Methodology and Verification](measurement_verification.md): Explains exactly how each measurement is collected, stored, and verified
- [Comparisons Directory](comparisons/README.md): Contains annotated visual comparisons that demonstrate the results
- [Detailed Results (JSON)](detailed_results.json): Contains all raw measurement data for independent verification

You can also reproduce the experiments yourself using our script:

```bash
python scripts/reproduce_experiment.py
```
