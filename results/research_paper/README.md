# AdaptiVision Research

This directory contains comprehensive research materials for the AdaptiVision adaptive object detection system. These materials document the innovations, methodology, and experimental results of the project.

## Contents

- [**Full Research Paper**](paper.md): A comprehensive technical paper documenting AdaptiVision's approach, methodology, and experimental results from the full COCO128 dataset
- [**Architecture Diagram**](architecture.svg): Detailed visualization of the AdaptiVision system architecture showing the complete data flow

## Key Innovations

The research paper documents four key innovations that set AdaptiVision apart from traditional object detection systems:

1. **Scene Complexity Analysis**: A multi-factor analysis system that evaluates each scene based on potential object count, size variance, and spatial distribution
   
2. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**: An algorithm that adapts confidence thresholds proportionally to scene complexity to optimize detection performance
   
3. **Context-Aware Reasoning**: A knowledge-based system that leverages object relationships to validate detections
   
4. **Class-Specific Adjustments**: A calibrated approach that applies different threshold modifications based on object class characteristics

## Experimental Results

The research is based on experiments run on the full COCO128 dataset, containing 128 diverse images. Key findings include:

- **28.4%** average increase in detection performance in complex scenes
- **17.2%** reduction in false positives in simple scenes
- **8.97Ã—** average speed improvement compared to standard detection
- Minimal computational overhead of only **4-7ms**
- Strong negative correlation (**-0.83**) between scene complexity and adaptive threshold
